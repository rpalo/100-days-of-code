# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup 100 days of code repo.  Finished [Javascript30 days 8 and 9](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous starting and doing something that is this public (even though this is not really even that public).  At least there are lots of people doing it with me.  I'm most excited about all the Console functionality I learned about in day 8 of JS30.  I think I'll be using ```console.assert()``` quite a bit more now.
