# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup 100 days of code repo.  Finished [Javascript30 days 8 and 9](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous starting and doing something that is this public (even though this is not really even that public).  At least there are lots of people doing it with me.  I'm most excited about all the Console functionality I learned about in day 8 of JS30.  I think I'll be using ```console.assert()``` quite a bit more now.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished several more days of Javascript30 (through 13 I think!).  Also started working on [Getting Started with P5.js](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032076.do).

**Thoughts**: Excited to get back to P5.js.  Got more than just 1 hour done today, closer to 3 or so.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the first 5 chapters of the book Getting Started with P5.js!

**Thoughts**: I knew most of this stuff, but it's good to learn it from another perspective and review.  There are lots of little tidbits I didn't know about.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another couple of episodes of JavaScript30!  15-18.  Over halfway!

**Thoughts**: I think this #100daysofcode is going to help me actually finish projects.  I need to find a more consistent time to code so it doesn't get left to the last minute and forgotten.

### Day 4: January 13, 2017

Missed it!

### Day 5: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a blog post about the JavaScript I'm learning from JavaScript 30!

**Thoughts**: I'm hoping I can make another post here in the next week or so.  That's the goal anyway.

**Link(s) to work**: [My blog!](rpalo.github.io) ... Although the link will soon have to change :)

### Day 6: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more JavaScript 30.  

**Thoughts**: Almost done!  I learned about the speach to text APIs and video camera APIs

### Day 7: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a poop-ton of JavaScript 30.  Also, got back onto adjusting my blog draft.  Added water droplets!

**Thoughts**: Not sure if I like the water droplets.

**Link(s) to work**: [The blog](https://github.com/rpalo/blog-draft) (See the p5-animations branch).  And again: [JavaScript30](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30).  One more day!!!

### Day 8: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FINISHED JAVASCRIPT 30!  Boom!  Started What-The-Flexbox, another one of Wes Bos's classes

**Thoughts**: I'm really learning a lot.  Who would have thought this 100 days of code would be so JavaScript focused!

**Link(s) to work**:  [JavaScript30](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30) and [What the FlexBox!](https://flexbox.io)

### Day 9: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated my personal blog site!  Got all of the styling and highlighting all fixed up along with some shwoopy Javascript courtesy of Wes Bos's class!

**Thoughts**:  This is very exciting.  I am definitely becoming more of a finisher with this 100 days of code.
