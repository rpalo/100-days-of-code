# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup 100 days of code repo.  Finished [Javascript30 days 8 and 9](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous starting and doing something that is this public (even though this is not really even that public).  At least there are lots of people doing it with me.  I'm most excited about all the Console functionality I learned about in day 8 of JS30.  I think I'll be using ```console.assert()``` quite a bit more now.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished several more days of Javascript30 (through 13 I think!).  Also started working on [Getting Started with P5.js](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032076.do).

**Thoughts**: Excited to get back to P5.js.  Got more than just 1 hour done today, closer to 3 or so.
