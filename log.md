# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setup 100 days of code repo.  Finished [Javascript30 days 8 and 9](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous starting and doing something that is this public (even though this is not really even that public).  At least there are lots of people doing it with me.  I'm most excited about all the Console functionality I learned about in day 8 of JS30.  I think I'll be using ```console.assert()``` quite a bit more now.

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished several more days of Javascript30 (through 13 I think!).  Also started working on [Getting Started with P5.js](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032076.do).

**Thoughts**: Excited to get back to P5.js.  Got more than just 1 hour done today, closer to 3 or so.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the first 5 chapters of the book Getting Started with P5.js!

**Thoughts**: I knew most of this stuff, but it's good to learn it from another perspective and review.  There are lots of little tidbits I didn't know about.

### Day 3: January 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another couple of episodes of JavaScript30!  15-18.  Over halfway!

**Thoughts**: I think this #100daysofcode is going to help me actually finish projects.  I need to find a more consistent time to code so it doesn't get left to the last minute and forgotten.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 18 of JS30 was the most interesting!](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30/tree/master/18%20-%20Adding%20Up%20Times%20with%20Reduce)

### Day 4: January 13, 2017

Missed it!

### Day 5: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a blog post about the JavaScript I'm learning from JavaScript 30!

**Thoughts**: I'm hoping I can make another post here in the next week or so.  That's the goal anyway.

**Link(s) to work**: [My blog!](rpalo.github.io) ... Although the link will soon have to change :)

### Day 6: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more JavaScript 30.  

**Thoughts**: Almost done!  I learned about the speach to text APIs and video camera APIs

**Link(s) to work**: [JavaScript30](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30)

### Day 7: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did a poop-ton of JavaScript 30.  Also, got back onto adjusting my blog draft.  Added water droplets!

**Thoughts**: Not sure if I like the water droplets.

**Link(s) to work**: [The blog](https://github.com/rpalo/blog-draft) (See the p5-animations branch).  And again: [JavaScript30](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30).  One more day!!!

### Day 8: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: FINISHED JAVASCRIPT 30!  Boom!  Started What-The-Flexbox, another one of Wes Bos's classes

**Thoughts**: I'm really learning a lot.  Who would have thought this 100 days of code would be so JavaScript focused!

**Link(s) to work**:  [JavaScript30](https://github.com/rpalo/JavaScript30) and [What the FlexBox!](https://flexbox.io)

### Day 9: January 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated my personal blog site!  Got all of the styling and highlighting all fixed up along with some shwoopy Javascript courtesy of Wes Bos's class!

**Thoughts**:  This is very exciting.  I am definitely becoming more of a finisher with this 100 days of code.

**Link(s) to work**: [My BLOG!](http://assertnotmagic.com)  (Link should work about 24 hours from this post.)

***
Sick 1/19-1/26!  Day 10 will be 1/27.  Back to it!

### Day 10: January 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress in Wes Bos's What the Flexbox class.

**Thoughts**: I generally am not a big fan of CSS, but this class is really interesting!

**Link(s) to work**: [My copy of what the flexbox](https://github.com/rpalo/what-the-flexbox)

### Day 11: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Used a combination of Google Sheets and R to munge/process the results of Jenny's science fair!  Figured out the winners based on an average normalized for judge grumpyness.  Made all manner of histograms and learned about the use of the `order` function in R.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to be able to use my learning for something real-life!

**Link to work**: No link today.  I'm pretty sure the student grades should remain anonymous.

### Day 12: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a portion of a book on making a JavaScript physics engine.

**Thoughts**: Not very into it today.  Hopefully I can get myself out of this slump.

**Links**: [The book](http://www.allitebooks.com/building-a-2d-game-physics-engine/)

### Day 13: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked some of Daniel Shiffman's A\* Pathfinding Screencast.

**Thoughts**: Takes me back to my AI class, which I mean to get back to at some point.

**Links**: [The video](https://youtu.be/aKYlikFAV4k)

### Day 14: January 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the official React Tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I really want to get into React, but I haven't quite found the guide/videos/tutorial that gets me where I want to go yet.

**Links**: [The Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

### Day 15: February 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Work through a portion of a Udacity class on OOP in JavaScript.  It has some useful insights into the class system, use of `this`, closures, and other more abstract things.

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about getting back at it again.

**Links**: [The class](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud015/lessons/2593668700/concepts/26167386300923)

### Day 16: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a new blog post about default arguments in python!  More work in the Udacity JavaScript OOP class.

**Thoughts**: I'm really proud of this blog post and the look of my blog in general.  I think it looks pretty great!

**Links**: [Default Arguments](http://assertnotmagic.com/2017/02/02/default-argument-tricks.html)

### Day 17: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made some more progress on my OOP class.

**Thoughts**: JavaScript OOP and prototype chains are quite a bit more complicated than I could have thought.  I think that's one thing about JavaScript I'm not sure about yet.  A lot less batteries included than some other languages.

**Links**: No new links.

### Day 18: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP class and the final project!  Started a new class on Ruby on Rails.

**Thoughts**: I think the ES6 way of doing classes in JavaScript is actually a good thing.  It seems to flow a little better.  It's definitely something that seems like it should have a simpler way of doing it.  It's definitely good to know what's going on behind the scenes though.

**Links**: [New class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ruby-on-rails-intro/home/welcome)

### Day 19: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more of the Ruby on Rails class.

**Thoughts**: I feel like Ruby should be way easier to install than it is.  Every time I've tried, I've had to do all kinds of digging online to figure out what's wrong.  Got it all working though!  `gem pristine --all` is the best!

**Links**: No new ones today.

### Day 20: February 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Ruby on Rails class.

**Thoughts**: They're taking me through the basics of Ruby, most of which I already know, but it's always good to get a new point of view from a new teacher.  You always learn new little tidbits or new ways of teaching something.

**Links**: None today.

### Day 21: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Found a website called cmdchallenge that has a bunch of challenges set up that require you to use bash in a browser-based shell to solve.  Rename all the files in the directory (recursively) so that the spaces are changed to periods, etc.

**Thoughts**: Very good practice and helps me learn the more powerful bash commands like find, awk, sed, and grep.

**Links**: [Command Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com/)

### Day 22: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spend more time with cmd challenge.  Also, I'm starting to try out Visual Studio Code as an editor.  

**Thoughts**: So far I really like VSCode!  It's like what you would expect if a multi-billion dollar company put itself behind Sublime Text.  I'll keep using it and maybe add a post to my blog.
